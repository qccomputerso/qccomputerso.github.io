Even with the amazing developments of modern computer science, we should not forget the giants of the past 
who paved the way for such a feat. Let's talk about some of them!
<br><br>

<b>Alan Turing (1912-1954)</b>
<br><br>
Turing has been dubbed "the father of computer science and artificial intelligence", quite rightfully as 
one of the most influential computer scientists even today. He invented the Turing Machine, a hypothetical 
abstract model of a CPU which is able to handle any computation action that can exist, whether or not it 
has been invented. It allows people to figure out what limitations any type of computer might have.
<br>
In WWII, Turing used his computational model to solve the "Enigma" code used by Nazi Germany, allowing 
them to decrypt all messages sent by them. This impeded the progres of the Nazis and saved countless 
lives. Unfortunately, due to his sexuality, he was driven to suicide by the British government at only 
the age of 42.
<br><br>

<b>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)</b>
<br><br>
Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the world's first computer scientist. In 1842, she published the first 
known example of an "algorithm", which can be thought of as a computer program. As an early example of a 
programmer, she realised the potential of calculators beyond solving simple arithmetics, and laid groundwork 
for far more complex computing today.
<br><br>

<b>Vinton Cerf (1943- ) and Robert Kahn (1938- )</b>
<br><br>
On Jan 1 1983, the world saw the Internet for the first time. Computer Scientists Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn 
played a big role in its invention, by developing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) 
which help networks communicate correctly and efficiently. IP is the most well known, acting like your home 
address but for your computer's position in the Internet instead, and it ensures that data is sent to the 
correct machines. This made the Internet possible, and most importantly, reliable, and the system is still 
being used and updated today.
<br><br>

<b>Guido van Rossum (1956- )</b>
<br><br>
Python is an all-pervasive language, being used in different tools and games like Dropbox and Battlefield 2, 
even acting as the language of choice for communicating with AI or robotics frameworks. Guido van Rossum 
invented python in the Christmas of 1989 when he was bored at home, and released the major edition Python 
0.9.0 in 1991. Python is still being updated today, with the latest version being 3.11.0. 
<br>
Python is intuitive and accomplishes a lot with few words. It is very declarative in nature, with many 
libraries helping it. However, since Python is fairly slow during execution, it may not be suitable 
for handling the backend of computationally heavy tasks.

"5G may affect air safety, warns airline company."
<br><br>
"K Kwong says that 5G should be turned off while sleeping."
<br><br>
You\u2019ve probably seen similar headlines before, but are they true? Will 5G really cause cancer or make planes crash?
<br><br>
Actually, what even is 5G used for?
<br><br>
Most peoples\u2019 know 5G for its high network speed- 5G is quicker than 4G by a magnitude of about 20 times! 
It\u2019s the newest standard in communications technology, developed from 4G. 5G is extremely fast because it 
transmits data using waves of high frequencies, meaning that more information can be fit into a single second. 
Unfortunately, this also has the caveat of making the transmission distance of 5G much shorter, so more 
broadcasting stations need to be set up.
<br>
Due to its high network speed, 5G has allowed for the development of a lot of new technology, in various areas 
such as self-driving cars, remote surgery, virtual reality, and drones.
<br><br>
5G affects health?
<br><br>
Anyone who has taken physics should know that higher frequency waves also have a higher energy, which can cause 
adverse health effects like cancer. However, 5G still has a much lower frequency than the more dangerous 
"ionising radiation", including high energy rays like ultraviolet and gamma. Due to its inability to ionise 
particles (duh), it causes much less harm to us. Additionally, studies from the UK have found that 5G can only 
penetrate the human body by 0.2cm, so the idea that 5G can cause cancer is but a myth.
<br><br>
5G causes plane crashes?
<br><br>
The frequency that flight instruments use to transmit data are typically in the range of 4.2GHz to 4.4GHz,
much higher than the usual standard for 5G which is 3.3GHz to 3.8GHz (Quite ironically, since nobody says flight
instruments are causing cancer), so the chance of interference is low. In fact, the USA has already permitted
certain telecommunications companies to set up 5G networks in the vicinity of airports!
<br><br>
To summarise, 5G has little to no effects on humans or flight safety. You can enjoy 5G to the fullest without
worrying about plane crashes or having your insides cooked.
