It can produce a variety of other interesting effects as well! The following program demonstration tries to
implement some of those effects, and speculates on how Minecraft might generate its biomes.

But beware- Active game development is a daunting task! Be sure you are willing to do some programming and maybe
even get on the technical side of things. You also need to listen to, as well as filter criticism brought up by
other people.
