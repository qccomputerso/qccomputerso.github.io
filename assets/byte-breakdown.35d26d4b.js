This data allows the AI to be trained far more accurately than using just a few images. ",-1)),T=["src"],I=t(" The central dogma of deepfakes lies in its face detection technology. First, we have to know where the faces actually are; Face detection algorithms are used to identify the presence and location of faces in images or video frames.

Without this step, training becomes significantly harder. "),x=a(()=>e("br",null,null,-1)),D=t(" The next step is identifying where all the features of the face are. This is done using other types of AI, most commonly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These networks take in the raw image of the face as the input, learning to identify features of the face with relatively little supervision. Using labels of features of the face rather than the whole image greatly increases the efficiency of deepfake models. The same thing is done for the source image or video so that the features of the target person's face can be mapped easily to the source face. This allows us to retain the facial expressions of the source face while having the appearance of the target face. "),F=a(()=>e("div",null," Next comes the process of generation. Nowadays, GANs are used for this purpose. First, an autoencoder is used to simplify the source image, while being able to reconstruct the modified image from the simplified data output. GANs consist of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates fake images, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Through an adversarial training process, where the error of the GAN decreases by generating images that the discriminator sees as real while the error of the discriminator decreases if it successfully identifies the output of the generator as fake, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic deepfake images. After training is done, only the generator is used to create fake images. ",-1)),N=["src"],S=t(" Some post-processing may have to be done to make the deepfakes generated more convincing. The generated face has to be blended into the target video or image to ensure that it seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context.

"),e("br"),t(" In the context of deepfakes, GANs are utilized to create convincing and deceptive content by training the generator specifically to produce synthetic images or videos that closely mimic the appearance of a specific target individual.
